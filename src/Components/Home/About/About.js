            <p>Be stronger than your excuses.Every positive thought propels you in the right direction. As a concept, a health club is more similar to a fitness center than a gym. The focus is on the whole-body wellness rather than just physical fitness. In fact, every high-end gym and fitness center can be classified as a health center, due to the variety of amenities.
            Health clubs comprise all the characteristics of both gyms and fitness centers â€“ there are individual and group classes, various amenities such as swimming pools, designated spaces for group sports such as basketball and volleyball, healthy food bars, etc.
